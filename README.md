Lemon is provided as an example of a basic framework for content sharing. ICE Blocks (RSS+) connects the database with the display of HTML5, CSS and JS. This is a full-stack PHP application that can be set up in minutes and turned into anything.

## MariaDB / MySQL
Apache/2+ PHP/5.6+ (mysqli)
Our projects are powered by open-source software.
 - Create a mysql database by importing 'itemcloud-db.sql'.
 - Assign a database user to mysql database (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).
 - Update config.php file database user and password.
 - Create a directory with read/write permissions ('files').
 - Now you should remove 'itemcloud-db.sql'.

## Road Map
 - Documentation
 - Better support for photos/video/audio with ffmpeg.
 - Packages with built in add-ons: Lime (2019), Orange (2020).
 - ItemCloud peer-to-peer networks and features forICE Blocks archive (the Future).
 - Tons of cool add-ons and layouts from the community
